# CS1027-Computer-Science-Fundmanetal-II
This repository contains my course work for an introductory Computer Science course in Java offered by the University of Western Ontario. I took this course in June 2019.

All uploaded submissions are as is and not corrected if there are any problems. 
This was my first programming course in Java. I have come a long way since then.
